              The Coke Fuel: Why Endurance Athletes Consume Coke During a Race
            </h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">July 7th, 2023</p>

            <p>
              When you hear the drink Coke, what is it that pops into your head?
              For me, it's obesity followed closely by sluggish. Yet whenever I
              watch someone on YouTube or elsewhere doing an ultra endurance
              race, I see them drinking cans of Coke at almost every aid
              station. Which immediately makes me wonder, why? Shouldn't you be
              drinking some highly tested and formulated sports drink that is
              designed for these exact scenarios? Maybe, but a lot of those
              sports drink mixes can be really hard to consume because they do
              not taste the best. So let's dive into some reasons why you might
              stash a Coke at your next transition.
            </p>
            <h3 id="rapid-energy-return">Rapid Energy Return</h3>
            <p>
              One of the main reasons that athletes are choosing to drink Coke
              is due to the fact that Coke is a very sugary drink. Which means
              that it has a large amount of carbohydrates from simple sugars
              like glucose and fructose. One of the main challenges is facing
              endurance athletes is the depletion in glycogen stores. These
              sugars are rapidly absorbed to the bloodstream. These sugars can
              be quickly used by the fatigued, working muscles providing a nice
              burst of energy and help replenish those glycogen stores. It's
              similar to your toddler eating some Halloween candy and getting
              that sugar rush and running around like a crazed monster.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the large amount of sugars, Coke also has a
              substantial amount of caffeine. Caffeine is known to lower your
              perceived exertion. Just like consuming a cup of coffee in the
              morning, the caffeine in Coke will also improve your alertness.
              These two things combined can help you push through mental and
              physical barriers.
            </p>
            <h3 id="gastric-emptying">Gastric Emptying</h3>
            <p>
              Gastric emptying is the process of food and fluids leaving the
              stomach and the small intestine. Carbonation acts as a stimulant
              for this process. Therefore Coke actually helps in speeding up the
              process and preventing discomfort or bloating that could happen.
              This can be particularly helpful later into a race in helping the
              body to quickly absorb nutrients and hydration.
            </p>
            <h3 id="mental-boost">Mental Boost</h3>
            <p>
              While any endurance event is obviously physically challenging, it
              is even more mental challenging. You have to be able to tell
              yourself to keep going when everything in your body is alerting
              you to stop. Drinking Coke can provide a psychological boost. The
              familiarity of the taste and positive experiences around drinking
              Coke can evoke feelings of comfort, motivation, and even
              nostalgia. No wonder why Coke's advertising always includes the
              sound of the pop top and “ahhhh.”

                ></iframe>
              </div>
            </div>
            <h3 id="convenience">Convenience</h3>
            <p>
              Lastly, Coke is just convenient. It's easy to find, it's ready to
              be consumed, and it just tastes good. Aid stations at most races
              now even offer Coke as a drink choice alongside water and
              Gatorade. So it's just easy to drop by an aid station or stop at a
              gas station and grab a Coke.
            </p>
            <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              So while it might be unconventional and eyebrow raising to drink a
              Coke during an endurance race, there are some solid reasons as to
              why you might want to stash a Coke at your next transition. The
              combination of all of these reasons make Coke an attractive choice
              for a quick and efficient source of fuel. That being said, I would
              still try this out in training before doing it on a whim in a
              race. You never know if your body will have an adverse effect but
              I know that I am going to give it a try at my next race.
