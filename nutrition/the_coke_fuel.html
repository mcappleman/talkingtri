            <p>
              Endurance athletes push their bodies to the limit, conquering
              miles upon miles in their quest for peak performance. Fueling
              their bodies effectively becomes crucial during these grueling
              events, and surprisingly, one beverage that has gained popularity
              among athletes is Coca-Cola, or simply Coke. While it may seem
              counterintuitive to consume a sugary carbonated drink during
              intense physical activity, there are specific reasons why
              endurance athletes have embraced Coke as a secret weapon to power
              them through races. In this article, we'll explore the science
              behind why athletes turn to Coke for a quick boost during a race.
