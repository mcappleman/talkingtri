            </h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">July 24th, 2023</p>

            <p>
              Sometimes training is fun and rewarding, but other times it is
              daunting. In those daunting times, doing a training session can be
              one of the last things that I want to do. It just seems awful. Do
              I really want to push myself that hard? I could just continue to
              happily scroll through my phone or get a couple extra hours of
              sleep. Which if you have a full time job and kids at home, those
              extra hours of sleep are all the more tempting. One of the easiest
              ways that I have found to find motivation is to take a step back
              and enjoy a YouTube video. I find that once the video has ended, I
              cannot wait to tackle the training session that I have on my
              calendar. I start to remind myself of the bigger picture and can
              get myself out of my current wallowing and yearning for instant
              gratification. So here is a list of my go to triathlon related
              YouTube channels to give me that extra boost I need.
            </p>
            <h3 id="that-triathlon-life">That Triathlon Life</h3>
            <p>
              That Triathlon Life, TTL, follows the life of pro triathletes Eric
              Lagerstrom and Paula Findlay. The thing that makes this channel
              pop is Ericâ€™s storytelling abilities through film and music. Eric
              creates stunning videos that will make you want to immediately hit
              up your local trails. I also have to shout out their good friend
              and musician Nick Goldston for providing some great music to
              accompany the videos. You can see this for yourself with one of
              their videos that was part of the 2022 Mountainfil Festival.

            <h3 id="passion-project">Passion Project</h3>
            <p>
              A newcomer to YouTube, pro triathlete Holly Lawrence and her
              partner Sean Jefferson have created another great channel. Most of
              the videos are vlog style and follow Holly around as she trains
              and races around the world. Again Sean has a nice blend of Q&A and
              beautiful training shots. Go subscribe if you have not already.

            <h3 id="lionel-sanders">Lionel Sanders</h3>
            <p>
              Lionel is always entertaining because he is never afraid to say
              what is exactly on his mind. In addition, Talbot Cox does a great
              job of mixing in some great training clips. Lionel is always full
              of insight and usually shares exactly what each workout is that he
              is doing. He is also very open and honest about where he is and
              where he wants to be.

            <h3 id="gtn">GTN</h3>
            <p>
              GTN, Global Triathlon Network, is the GCN equivalent for
              triathlon. Sure there is some overlap between GCN and GTN, but I
              think that is only to the benefit of each. They have a number of
              videos where GTN competes against GCN, which is always
              entertaining. In addition, the GTN news show is a great way to
              keep up to date with all thing triathlon, not just North American
              long course athletes.

            <p>
              When you want to get hyped for the upcoming PTO races or hear more
              backstory behind all of the big name pros, the PTO Hub is where
              you go. The PTO has done an unbelievable job of promoting and
              marketing the pros in order to bring more attention to triathlon.
              Everyone has a story, and they do a great job of making those
              stories accessible.

              These are just a handful of my go to YouTube channels for
              inspiration. I am constantly looking for new channels to follow as
              well. Please share your favorite channels or videos in the
